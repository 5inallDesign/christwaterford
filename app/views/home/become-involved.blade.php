<h1>Are there opportunities for me to become involved?</h1>
        
<p>Absolutely; but you don't have to feel obligated. You may choose to sing in the choir, usher, greet worshipers at the door before services or act as a reader during worship. Our tech team is always looking for people who enjoy working a camera to record our services for our local cable station, manage the sound board, or run the projector.</p>
<p>At Christ Lutheran, there's always something worthwhile to do.</p>

<p>We actively participate in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Habitat for Humanity</li>
    <li>CROP Walk for Hunger</li>
    <li>Community-wide Good Friday services</li>
    <li>Community projects through WELCA, our active women's group</li>
    <li>A gigantic yard sale every other year</li>
</ul>
