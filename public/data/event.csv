It asks us to not just to &bdquo;give something&nbsp;up? but add something to our life that will help us spiritually grow. Our&nbsp;Ash Wednesday service will include the imposition of ashes as a sign of our willingness to turn&nbsp;away from things that draw us from God, and toward those things that will draw us closer to&nbsp;God. Holy Communion will also be celebrated. See inside this newsletter for more&nbsp;opportunities to grow this Lenten Season.</p>","Y","N"
