It asks us to not just to &bdquo;give something&nbsp;up? but add something to our life that will help us spiritually grow. Our&nbsp;Ash Wednesday service will include the imposition of ashes as a sign of our willingness to turn&nbsp;away from things that draw us from God, and toward those things that will draw us closer to&nbsp;God. Holy Communion will also be celebrated. See inside this newsletter for more&nbsp;opportunities to grow this Lenten Season.</p>",1,0,97

Hit the streets of Waterford raising funds for hunger causes around the world. This year’s
goal is set at $15,000. As a congregation last year we led the way raising over $3600. There
will be
Three routes to choose to walk: a one mile, three mile and five mile. There will also be a
rocking chair available for those who may have difficulty walking.
Sponsor forms are available Sundays after worship, or contact the church office. If you
cannot walk please be sure to support someone who is. Local agencies that will benefit from
these funds are the Open Door Outreach Center of Waterford, Waterford Meals on Wheels,
Good Samaritan
Food Pantry of Pontiac, and the Baldwin Center of Pontiac.",1,0,NULL
