<h1>It's people like you who make our church special</h1>
        
<p>With your personality, your unique gifts and abilities... there is no one else quite like you.</p>
<p>You're an individual.</p>
<p>And at Christ Lutheran, we're a lot like you. We're a group of individuals who have come together to worship God. At the same time we recognize that there is no ONE way to baptize or commune. No one way to pray. No one way to worship.</p>
<p>Each of us may be in a different place along our journey of life and faith, and we respect the beliefs of others along the way. We recognize that we are all God's children and can learn from one another.</p>
<p>We're glad you're here.</p>
