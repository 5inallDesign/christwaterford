<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Officially, we're a congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. The ELCA consists of 3.5 million baptized members and over 9,200 congregations. We are a part of the Southeast Michigan Synod and, as part of the larger ELCA, our congregation's ministry extends locally, regionally and globally.</p>

<p>As Lutherans, we are Protestant Christians who accept the teachings of Martin Luther (1483 - 1546), who led the Reformation of the Church in 1517. His famous Ninety-Five Theses were challenges to the church of his day to reform its teachings and practices to be more consistent with the Word of God.</p>

<p>Christ Lutheran was organized as a congregation on October 23, 1944 in Waterford Township. On February 13, 1949, our congregation held its first worship service in our own building at its present site near Williams Lake and Airport Roads. </p>

<p>Currently, the congregation is made up of over 400 baptized members with an average weekly worship attendance of approximately 100.</p>

<h2>What do we believe?</h2>

<p>We're a group of individuals who have come together to worship God. At the same time we recognize that there is no ONE way to baptize or commune. No ONE way to pray.</p>

<p>Each of us may be in a different place along our journey of life and faith, and we respect the beliefs of others along the way. We recognize that we are all God's children and can learn from one another.</p>

<h2>Do I have to be Lutheran to attend your services?</h2>

<p>Everyone is welcome at Christ Lutheran. For the most part, we use the standard, easy-to-follow Lutheran liturgy in our services. The words are printed in your bulletin and projected onto a large screen during the service.</p>

<p>We have an open communion policy that welcomes everyone to the Lord's table.</p>
