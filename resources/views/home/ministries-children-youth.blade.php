<h1>Children and Youth Team</h1>

<p>Kids are always welcome here. We have a nursery for children three and under during Sunday morning services. Kids hear a special message from the Pastor before going to their own Sunday Alive! activities downstairs.</p>

<p>We have an active youth group for middle and high school kids that includes activities like bowling, camping trips, scavenger hunts, community service projects, and fund raisers.</p>
